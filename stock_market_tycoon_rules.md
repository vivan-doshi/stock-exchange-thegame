## Trader Mode: Basic Rules

### Turn Structure

Each market year consists of up to 3 transaction rounds. Turn order rotates clockwise, with the dealer going last.

**On Your Turn (choose ONE action):**
- Buy shares in one company
- Sell shares in one company
- Use a special card

### Buying Shares

**Minimum Purchase Rules:**
- Minimum denomination: $5,000
- Minimum shares: 1,000 shares
- Must buy in multiples of 1,000 shares

**The Buy Condition:**
You can ONLY buy a stock if the price cards in your hand for that stock add up to ZERO or POSITIVE.

**Example:**
- You have 4 NovaTech cards: -30, +20, +30, -5
- Total: +15 (positive) ‚úì You CAN buy NovaTech
- If the cards were: -30, -20, +5, -5
- Total: -50 (negative) ‚úó You CANNOT buy NovaTech

**EXCEPTION:** If you are the FIRST buyer of that stock in that entire market year (regardless of transaction round), you can buy even with negative cards.

### Selling Shares

- You can sell any shares you own at current market price
- No restrictions on selling
- You can sell and buy the same stock in the same market year (if you meet buy conditions)

### End of Market Year

1. **Reveal Cards**: Starting from the player to the right of the dealer and going clockwise, each player reveals all their price cards
2. **Calculate Price Changes**: Add up all price changes for each stock
3. **Update Prices**: Adjust the share price chart with new prices
4. **Apply Special Cards**: Process Share Suspended cards in turn order
5. **Apply Currency Cards**: Calculate +10% or -10% effects on cash holdings
6. **New Round**: Dealer position rotates clockwise

## Special Cards

### Transaction Cards
(These take up one of your transaction turns)

#### Loan Stocks Matured (2 cards)
- Receive $100,000 from the bank
- Must be used during a transaction round (cannot claim at end of round)
- Uses one entire transaction

#### Debenture (2 cards)
- **Condition**: Stock must hit $0 in the SAME round you received this card AND you must own shares
- **Effect**: Receive face value (original starting price) for ALL your shares of that stock
- Example: Global Industries crashes to $0, you own 10,000 shares ‚Üí receive $450,000 (10,000 √ó $45)
- Must be used during a transaction round
- Uses one entire transaction

#### Rights Issued (2 cards)
- Buy 1 share for every 2 shares you own at $10 per share
- **Important**: When you use this, every player sitting AFTER you in that same transaction round can also exercise this right if they own shares in that company
- Example: You're Player 1 of 4, you use Rights on Titan Steel in Transaction 2
  - Players 2, 3, 4 can exercise in Transaction 2 on their turns
  - If you're Player 4 (dealer), no one else benefits
- Uses one transaction

### End-of-Year Cards
(These are applied after all transactions complete)

#### Share Suspended (2 cards)
- **Timing**: Applied AFTER all price changes are calculated at end of market year
- **Effect**: Resets ONE stock's price back to the previous market year's price (NOT face value)
- **Order**: Players use these in turn order (right of dealer to dealer)
- **Power**: Cannot be overridden by Director or Chairman powers
- **Strategy**: Use to suspend your closest competitor's stock or the biggest gainer

#### Currency +10% (3 cards)
- Add 10% to your cash holdings (uninvested money only)
- **Stacking**: Multiple cards stack (2 cards = +20%, 3 cards = +30%)
- Can cancel with -10% cards (one +10% and one -10% = 0% effect)
- Applied AFTER stock prices are finalized
- Only affects cash in hand, NOT invested in stocks
- If you have Rs 0 cash (100% invested), no effect

#### Currency -10% (3 cards)
- Subtract 10% from your cash holdings (uninvested money only)
- **Stacking**: Multiple cards stack (2 cards = -20%)
- Applied AFTER stock prices are finalized
- Only affects cash in hand, NOT invested in stocks
- If you have Rs 0 cash (100% invested), no effect

## Special Powers

### Director (25% Ownership)

**Requirement:** Own 50,000 shares (25% of 2,00,000)

**Power:** Remove ONE of your own price cards from the end-of-year tally for that stock

**How It Works:**
- At end of market year when revealing cards, you can choose not to reveal one of your cards for that company
- That card doesn't count toward price calculation
- Strategic: Cancel out your worst negative card or save your best positive card for next round

**Multiple Companies:** You can be Director of multiple companies simultaneously

**Tiebreaker:** If 2 players both have 25-49.9% ownership, the player with MORE shares becomes Director

### Chairman (50% Ownership)

**Requirement:** Own 1,00,000 shares (50% of 2,00,000)

**Power:** Remove ONE card from ANY PLAYER for that stock from the end-of-year tally

**How It Works:**
- At end of market year, you can prevent any player's card from counting toward price calculation
- Much stronger than Director (can target opponents)
- Strategic: Cancel the worst negative card against your stock, or prevent a competitor's positive card

**Only One Chairman:** If 2 players reach 50%, the FIRST to reach it becomes Chairman, the other becomes Director

**Limitation:** CANNOT override Share Suspended special cards

---

## Investor Mode: Shorting

**Available after completing 3 games in Trader Mode**

### What is Shorting?

Shorting allows you to profit when a stock price DECREASES. You're betting against a stock.

### Shorting Rules

**Initiating a Short:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- You can short 1,000 to 12,000 shares per stock per market year
- Maximum 12,000 shares total can be shorted for any stock (across ALL players)
- **CRITICAL**: You CANNOT short a stock you currently own

**Settlement:**
- Settled at end of market year AFTER currency cards are applied
- If stock price DECREASED: Bank pays you the difference per share
- If stock price INCREASED: You pay the bank the difference per share

**Example:**
- You short 10,000 Titan Steel shares at $60
- **Scenario A** - Price drops to $40: You receive $200,000 from bank ($20 √ó 10,000)
- **Scenario B** - Price rises to $80: You pay $200,000 to bank ($20 √ó 10,000)

**Inability to Pay:**
- If you cannot pay your short debt, you have until the FIRST transaction of the next market year to settle
- 10% interest applied on the debt
- Only allowed if your total stock value is less than your debt
- If still unable to pay: **Declared bankrupt and removed from game**

**Strategic Note:** Shorting is high risk, high reward. You can short even if you have positive cards for that stock.

## Strategist Mode: Options, Dividends & Buybacks

**Available after winning 2 games in Investor Mode**

Options, dividends, and buybacks represent the pinnacle of stock market strategy, giving players sophisticated tools for wealth building and corporate control.

### Options Trading

Options give you the RIGHT (but not obligation) to buy or sell shares at a predetermined price by the end of the market year.

#### Call Options (Right to BUY)

**How It Works:**
- Purchase the right to BUY shares at the current "strike price" by year-end
- Pay a premium upfront
- At year-end, if the stock price is HIGHER than your strike price, you exercise and profit
- If price is lower, you don't exercise (only lose premium)

**Example:**
- NovaTech is at $80
- You buy a call option for 5,000 shares at $80 strike
- Premium: $40,000 (10% of $400,000)
- **Year-End Scenario A** - NovaTech at $120:
  - Exercise! Buy at $80, immediately worth $120
  - Profit: ($120 - $80) √ó 5,000 - $40,000 = $160,000
- **Year-End Scenario B** - NovaTech at $60:
  - Don't exercise (why buy at $80 when market is $60?)
  - Loss: $40,000 (premium only)

#### Put Options (Right to SELL)

**How It Works:**
- Purchase the right to SELL shares at the current "strike price" by year-end
- Pay a premium upfront
- At year-end, if stock price is LOWER than your strike price, you exercise and profit
- If price is higher, you don't exercise (only lose premium)

**Example:**
- VitalCare Pharma is at $75
- You buy a put option for 5,000 shares at $75 strike
- Premium: $37,500 (10% of $375,000)
- **Year-End Scenario A** - VitalCare Pharma at $40:
  - Exercise! Sell at $75 when market is $40
  - Profit: ($75 - $40) √ó 5,000 - $37,500 = $137,500
- **Year-End Scenario B** - VitalCare Pharma at $100:
  - Don't exercise (why sell at $75 when market is $100?)
  - Loss: $37,500 (premium only)

#### Option Mechanics

**Availability:**
- Maximum 20% of each stock's shares can be under options per round
- Per stock limit: 40,000 shares (20% of 2,00,000)
- First-come, first-served within each market year

**Premium Rate:**
- Base premium: 10% of total strike value
- **Chairman Power**: Before cards are dealt, Chairman of each company can adjust THEIR company's premium by ¬±5%
  - Can set at 5%, 10%, or 15%
  - Must announce before anyone looks at cards
  - Strategic: Low premium (5%) encourages options trading; high premium (15%) discourages it

**Premium Calculation:**
- Premium = Strike Price √ó Number of Shares √ó Premium Rate
- Example: Omega Energy at $55, call option for 10,000 shares at 12% premium
  - Premium = $55 √ó 10,000 √ó 12% = $66,000

**Buying Options:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- Pay premium to bank immediately
- Record strike price, number of shares, and expiration (current market year)

**Exercise Timing:**
- Options are exercised at END of market year
- After price changes calculated
- After currency cards applied
- Before new round begins

**Important Limitations:**
- Options DO NOT count toward Director/Chairman ownership
- Options DO NOT receive dividends
- Options DO NOT qualify for Rights Issued
- Options are pure speculation without control benefits

**Why Buy Stocks Instead of Options?**
1. Director/Chairman powers only come from stock ownership
2. Higher absolute profits on large moves
3. Eligible for dividends
4. Can exercise Rights Issued
5. No premium cost eating into profits

### Dividends

Dividends allow Directors and Chairmen to extract cash from the company and pay all shareholders.

#### Who Can Issue Dividends

- **Director** (25-49.9% ownership): Up to $10 per share
- **Chairman** (50%+ ownership): Up to $20 per share
- Both can issue in the same round (cumulative effect)

#### Dividend Mechanics

**Declaring Dividend:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- Announce dividend amount per share
- All shareholders receive payment IMMEDIATELY from the bank
- Stock price DROPS by dividend amount immediately

**Example:**
- You're Chairman of Global Industries with 100,000 shares
- Global Industries trading at $60
- You declare $15 dividend per share
- **Effects:**
  - You receive: $15 √ó 100,000 = $1,500,000
  - All other shareholders paid proportionally
  - Global Industries price drops to $45 immediately
  - Other players can use this cash in subsequent transactions this round

**Strategic Uses:**
- Extract value from expensive stocks
- Get cash for other investments
- Reduce stock price to make it more attractive to buyers
- Reward shareholders (including yourself)
- Deny put option holders (their strike becomes less valuable)

#### Director Dividends When Chairman Exists

If both Director and Chairman exist for a company:
- Director can still issue dividend (up to Rs 10/share) independently
- Chairman can issue dividend (up to Rs 20/share) independently  
- If both issue in same round, both pay out (cumulative)
- This is rare since both use transaction slots

### Buybacks

Buybacks allow Chairmen to repurchase shares from the market, reducing supply and increasing price.

#### Who Can Issue Buybacks

**Only Chairman** (50%+ ownership)

#### Buyback Mechanics

**Announcing Buyback:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- Chairman declares:
  - Number of shares to buy back (e.g., 20,000)
  - Price per share (e.g., Rs 55)

**Selling Priority - Turn Order:**
1. Starting with the NEXT player in turn order after Chairman
2. Each player in clockwise sequence can sell shares at announced price
3. First-come, first-served until buyback limit reached
4. Selling does NOT use the seller's transaction turn
5. Happens immediately within that same round

**Example:**
- Chairman announces: "Buying back 20,000 Omega Energy shares at $60"
- Turn order after Chairman: Bob ‚Üí Carol ‚Üí David
- Bob sells 8,000 shares (receives $480,000)
- Carol sells 15,000 shares (receives $900,000) ‚Äî LIMIT REACHED
- Only 12,000 bought from Carol; 3,000 refused
- David cannot sell (limit reached)

**Effects of Buyback:**
- Shares permanently retired from game
- Total shares outstanding decreases (from 200,000)
- Everyone's ownership percentage increases
- Stock price increases: **+$5 per 10,000 shares bought back**

**Complete Example:**
- You're Chairman of VitalCare Pharma with 100,000 shares (50%)
- VitalCare Pharma at $75, total shares: 200,000
- You announce buyback: 30,000 shares at $78
- Players sell 30,000 shares total for $2,340,000
- **Results:**
  - Total shares now: 170,000 (30,000 retired)
  - Your ownership: 100,000 of 170,000 = 58.8% (was 50%)
  - Stock price: $75 + $15 ($5 per 10k) = $90
  - Your wealth increased significantly!

**Strategic Uses:**
- Consolidate control (increase your ownership %)
- Boost stock price
- Remove shares from competitors
- Deploy excess cash productively
- Defend against hostile takeover attempts
- Create upward price momentum

**Timing Strategy:**
- Announce in Transaction 1: More players get a chance to sell
- Announce in Transaction 3: Fewer opportunities for opponents, more control over who benefits

## Strategies to Win

### Early Game (Rounds 1-3)

1. **Buy Volatile Stocks When Cheap**
   - NovaTech and VitalCare Pharma at $10-30 are excellent investments
   - High volatility = high potential returns
   - Your cards will tell you which direction they'll move

2. **Aim for Director Status Fast**
   - 50,000 shares (25%) gives you card suppression power
   - Easier to achieve in early rounds when prices are low
   - Example: Atlas Bank at $15 = only $750,000 for Director status

3. **Read Your Cards**
   - If you have multiple positive cards for one stock, invest heavily
   - If you have negative cards, avoid that stock OR consider shorting (Doshi Rules)

4. **First Buyer Exception**
   - Take advantage of being first buyer with negative cards
   - Can establish early position before others

### Mid Game (Rounds 4-7)

5. **Push for Chairman Control**
   - 1,00,000 shares (50%) gives massive power
   - Can manipulate stock prices by removing any player's cards
   - Your controlled stock becomes your wealth multiplier

6. **Diversify Carefully**
   - Don't spread too thin
   - Better to control 1-2 stocks strongly than own small amounts of many
   - Exception: Options allow cheap diversification (Doshi Rules v2)

7. **Watch Competitor Positions**
   - If someone is approaching Director/Chairman, consider:
     - Buying to block them
     - Using Share Suspended to hurt their stock
     - Buyback to consolidate your own position (if you're Chairman)

7. **Calculate Rights Issued Setups**
   - If you can buy to 37,000 shares and still afford Rights exercise
   - Rights at $10 can give you 18,500 more shares cheaply = Director status
   - Watch for others buying large amounts (they're likely setting up for Rights)

### Late Game (Rounds 8-10)

9. **Lock In Profits Safely**
   - If ahead, shift to safer stocks (Wockhardt, HDFC)
   - Use dividends to extract value from expensive stocks (Doshi Rules v2)
   - Consider options for speculation instead of risky stock purchases

10. **Manage Cash vs Investment**
    - Watch for Currency +10% / -10% cards in your hand
    - If you have -10% cards, invest all cash in stocks
    - If you have +10% cards, keep some cash uninvested
    - Balance risk of keeping cash vs being fully invested

11. **Use Share Suspended Strategically**
    - Target the player in first place
    - OR target the stock that gained the most this round
    - Timing matters: save it for maximum impact rounds

12. **Understand Stock Volatility Impact**
    - +5 to +15 in NovaTech might be cancelled out by other cards (12 total cards)
    - +20 in Atlas Bank is HUGE (only 4 total cards, hard to counter)
    - Adjust expectations based on card volume

### Advanced Strategies (Investor & Strategist Modes)

13. **Shorting for Defense**
    - Short your opponent's stocks to profit from their misfortune
    - Maximum impact when you know they'll crash (based on your cards)
    - Limit risk: only short 12,000 shares maximum

14. **Options for Leverage**
    - If you have great cards but limited cash, buy call options
    - 10% premium controls full position
    - Loss limited to premium if wrong

15. **Dividend Timing**
    - Issue dividends EARLY in round so you can reinvest the cash
    - Or issue LATE to deny opponents the chance to use the cash
    - Use to crash stock price if you have put options

16. **Buyback for Control**
    - When approaching 50%, use buyback to push over the edge
    - Reduces shares outstanding = increases your %
    - Bonus: stock price rises too

17. **Chairman Premium Manipulation**
    - Set low premiums (5%) to encourage options instead of share buying
    - Protects your chairmanship (fewer people buying actual shares)
    - Set high premiums (15%) when you want to discourage speculation

## Common Mistakes

### Trader Mode Mistakes

1. **Buying Without Checking Cards**
   - Always calculate if your cards add to positive/zero before buying
   - Exception: First buyer of market year can ignore this

2. **Buying Fractional Shares**
   - Minimum 1,000 shares ($5,000 denomination)
   - Cannot buy 500 shares or $2,000 worth

3. **Forgetting the Buy Condition**
   - You CANNOT buy if your cards for that stock sum to negative
   - Many new players miss this critical rule

4. **Selling at the Wrong Time**
   - Selling right before a stock rises (based on your cards)
   - Hold if your cards show positive movement coming

5. **Ignoring Currency Cards**
   - Keeping $200,000 cash with -20% cards = lose $40,000
   - Could have invested that cash instead

6. **Not Planning for Rights Issued**
   - Others buying at high prices likely have Rights Issued card
   - Be ready to exercise if you own shares
   - Don't over-invest if you might need cash for Rights

### Investor Mode Mistakes

7. **Over-Diversifying**
   - Owning 5,000 shares of each company = no control power
   - Focus on 1-2 companies for Director/Chairman status

8. **Under-Estimating Volatility**
   - NovaTech can swing ¬±30 per round
   - Atlas Bank only swings ¬±10 per round
   - Adjust position sizes accordingly

9. **Missing Share Suspended Opportunities**
   - Not using Share Suspended on the right target
   - Timing it poorly (wasting it on small moves)

10. **Ignoring Turn Order**
    - Being last (dealer) means missing out on Rights Issued benefits
    - Being first means you can't see others' moves
    - Plan accordingly

11. **Poor Transaction Slot Management**
    - Using all 3 transactions too quickly
    - Better to save transaction for reactive plays
    - Watch what others do first

### Strategist Mode Mistakes

12. **Shorting Your Own Stock**
    - Cannot short a stock you own (Investor Mode)
    - Must sell first, then short

13. **Over-Shorting**
    - 12,000 share limit exists for a reason
    - Going bankrupt ends your game
    - Only short what you can afford to lose

14. **Buying Options When You Need Control**
    - Options don't count toward Director/Chairman
    - If your goal is control, buy actual shares
    - Options are for speculation, not governance

15. **Ignoring Option Premiums**
    - At 15% premium, options become expensive
    - Sometimes better to just buy shares
    - Calculate break-even before committing

16. **Poor Dividend Timing**
    - Issuing dividend in Transaction 3 = opponents can't use the cash
    - Issuing in Transaction 1 = opponents can reinvest immediately
    - Choose based on your strategy

17. **Wasteful Buybacks**
    - Buying back when already at 70% ownership = diminishing returns
    - Better to deploy cash elsewhere
    - Buyback most effective when close to 50% threshold

18. **Forgetting Buyback Price Rise**
    - Stock price rises $5 per 10,000 shares bought back
    - Factor this into your calculations
    - Can make buyback very expensive

### Investor Mode (Shorting) Questions

**Q: Can I short a stock I own?**  
A: No, you must not own any shares of that stock to short it.

**Q: What if I short 10,000 shares and the price goes up $50?**  
A: You owe $500,000 to the bank. Pay it at end of market year.

**Q: Can I cover my short position mid-year?**  
A: No, shorts are settled only at end of market year.

**Q: What's the maximum I can short?**

**Q: If I go bankrupt, do I lose?**

### Strategist Mode (Options/Dividends/Buybacks) Questions

A: No, options are only exercised at end of market year.

**Q: If I buy a call option and the stock drops, do I lose more than the premium?**  
A: No, your maximum loss is the premium paid.

**Q: Do options count toward Director/Chairman ownership?**

**Q: Can I receive dividends on my call options?**  
A: No, only actual shareholders receive dividends.

**Q: If I'm Chairman with 60% ownership, can I issue multiple dividends per round?**  
A: No, each dividend uses one transaction. You could issue in Transaction 1 and Transaction 3, but that uses 2 of your 3 transactions.

**Q: Does issuing a dividend affect my Chairman status?**  
A: No, you still own the same number of shares. The price drops but your ownership % stays the same.

**Q: In a buyback, what if I want to sell but I'm last in turn order?**  
A: You might miss out if the buyback limit is reached before your turn. That's why turn order matters.

**Q: Can Chairman refuse to buy back from specific players?**  
A: No, buyback follows strict turn order. Chairman cannot pick and choose.

**Q: What happens to shares bought back?**  
A: They're permanently retired. Total shares outstanding decreases.
