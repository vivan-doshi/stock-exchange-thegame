## Trader Mode: Basic Rules

### Turn Structure

Each market year consists of up to 3 transaction rounds. Turn order rotates clockwise, with the dealer going last.

**On Your Turn (choose ONE action):**
- Buy shares in one company
- Sell shares in one company
- Use a special card

### Buying Shares

**Minimum Purchase Rules:**
- Minimum denomination: $5,000
- Minimum shares: 1,000 shares
- Must buy in multiples of 1,000 shares

**The Buy Condition:**
You can ONLY buy a stock if the price cards in your hand for that stock add up to ZERO or POSITIVE.

**Example:**
- You have 4 NovaTech cards: -30, +20, +30, -5
- Total: +15 (positive) ‚úì You CAN buy NovaTech
- If the cards were: -30, -20, +5, -5
- Total: -50 (negative) ‚úó You CANNOT buy NovaTech

**EXCEPTION:** If you are the FIRST buyer of that stock in that entire market year (regardless of transaction round), you can buy even with negative cards.

### Selling Shares

- You can sell any shares you own at current market price
- No restrictions on selling
- You can sell and buy the same stock in the same market year (if you meet buy conditions)

### End of Market Year

1. **Reveal Cards**: Starting from the player to the right of the dealer and going clockwise, each player reveals all their price cards
2. **Calculate Price Changes**: Add up all price changes for each stock
3. **Update Prices**: Adjust the share price chart with new prices
4. **Apply Special Cards**: Process Share Suspended cards in turn order
5. **Apply Currency Cards**: Calculate +10% or -10% effects on cash holdings
6. **New Round**: Dealer position rotates clockwise

## Special Cards

### Transaction Cards
(These take up one of your transaction turns)

#### Loan Stocks Matured (2 cards in Standard, 4 cards in Extended)
- Receive $100,000 from the bank
- Must be used during a transaction round (cannot claim at end of round)
- Uses one entire transaction

#### Debenture (2 cards in Standard, 4 cards in Extended)
- **Condition**: Stock must hit $0 in the SAME round you received this card AND you must own shares
- **Effect**: Receive face value (original starting price) for ALL your shares of that stock
- Example: Global Industries crashes to $0, you own 10,000 shares ‚Üí receive $450,000 (10,000 √ó $45)
- Must be used during a transaction round
- Uses one entire transaction

#### Rights Issued (2 cards in Standard, 4 cards in Extended)
- Buy 1 share for every 2 shares you own at $10 per share
- **Important**: When you use this, every player sitting AFTER you in that same transaction round can also exercise this right if they own shares in that company
- Example: You're Player 1 of 4, you use Rights on Titan Steel in Transaction 2
  - Players 2, 3, 4 can exercise in Transaction 2 on their turns
  - If you're Player 4 (dealer), no one else benefits
- Uses one transaction

### End-of-Year Cards
(These are applied after all transactions complete)

#### Share Suspended (2 cards in Standard, 4 cards in Extended)
- **Timing**: Applied AFTER all price changes are calculated at end of market year
- **Effect**: Resets ONE stock's price back to the previous market year's price (NOT face value)
- **Order**: Players use these in turn order (right of dealer to dealer)
- **Power**: Cannot be overridden by Director or Chairman powers
- **Strategy**: Use to suspend your closest competitor's stock or the biggest gainer

#### Currency +10% (3 cards in Standard, 6 cards in Extended)
- Add 10% to your cash holdings (uninvested money only)
- **Stacking**: Multiple cards stack (2 cards = +20%, 3 cards = +30%)
- Can cancel with -10% cards (one +10% and one -10% = 0% effect)
- Applied AFTER stock prices are finalized
- Only affects cash in hand, NOT invested in stocks
- If you have $0 cash (100% invested), no effect

#### Currency -10% (3 cards in Standard, 6 cards in Extended)
- Subtract 10% from your cash holdings (uninvested money only)
- **Stacking**: Multiple cards stack (2 cards = -20%)
- Applied AFTER stock prices are finalized
- Only affects cash in hand, NOT invested in stocks
- If you have $0 cash (100% invested), no effect

## Special Powers

### Director

**Standard Variant:** 50,000 shares (25% of 200,000)  
**Extended Variant:** 60,000 shares (20% of 300,000)

**Power:** Remove ONE of your own price cards from the end-of-year tally for that stock

**How It Works:**
- At end of market year when revealing cards, you can choose not to reveal one of your cards for that company
- That card doesn't count toward price calculation
- Strategic: Cancel out your worst negative card or save your best positive card for next round

**Multiple Companies:** You can be Director of multiple companies simultaneously

**Tiebreaker:** If 2 players both have ownership between Director and Chairman thresholds, the player with MORE shares becomes Director

### Chairman

**Standard Variant:** 100,000 shares (50% of 200,000)  
**Extended Variant:** 120,000 shares (40% of 300,000)

**Power:** Remove ONE card from ANY PLAYER for that stock from the end-of-year tally

**How It Works:**
- At end of market year, you can prevent any player's card from counting toward price calculation
- Much stronger than Director (can target opponents)
- Strategic: Cancel the worst negative card against your stock, or prevent a competitor's positive card

**Only One Chairman:** If 2 players reach the threshold, the FIRST to reach it becomes Chairman, the other becomes Director

**Limitation:** CANNOT override Share Suspended special cards

---

## Investor Mode: Shorting

**Available after completing 3 games in Trader Mode**

### What is Shorting?

Shorting allows you to profit when a stock price DECREASES. You're betting against a stock.

### Shorting Rules

**Initiating a Short:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- You can short 1,000 to 12,000 shares per stock per market year
- Maximum 12,000 shares total can be shorted for any stock (across ALL players)
- **CRITICAL**: You CANNOT short a stock you currently own

**Settlement:**
- Settled at end of market year AFTER currency cards are applied
- If stock price DECREASED: Bank pays you the difference per share
- If stock price INCREASED: You pay the bank the difference per share

**Example:**
- You short 10,000 Titan Steel shares at $60
- **Scenario A** - Price drops to $40: You receive $200,000 from bank ($20 √ó 10,000)
- **Scenario B** - Price rises to $80: You pay $200,000 to bank ($20 √ó 10,000)

**Inability to Pay:**
- If you cannot pay your short debt, you have until the FIRST transaction of the next market year to settle
- 10% interest applied on the debt
- Only allowed if your total stock value is less than your debt
- If still unable to pay: **Declared bankrupt and removed from game**

**Strategic Note:** Shorting is high risk, high reward. You can short even if you have positive cards for that stock.

## Strategist Mode: Options, Dividends & Buybacks

**Available after winning 2 games in Investor Mode**

Options, dividends, and buybacks represent the pinnacle of stock market strategy, giving players sophisticated tools for wealth building and corporate control.

### Options Trading

Options give you the RIGHT (but not obligation) to buy or sell shares at a predetermined price by the end of the market year.

#### Call Options (Right to BUY)

**How It Works:**
- Purchase the right to BUY shares at the current "strike price" by year-end
- Pay a premium upfront
- At year-end, if the stock price is HIGHER than your strike price, you exercise and profit
- If price is lower, you don't exercise (only lose premium)

**Example:**
- NovaTech is at $80
- You buy a call option for 5,000 shares at $80 strike
- Premium: $40,000 (10% of $400,000)
- **Year-End Scenario A** - NovaTech at $120:
  - Exercise! Buy at $80, immediately worth $120
  - Profit: ($120 - $80) √ó 5,000 - $40,000 = $160,000
- **Year-End Scenario B** - NovaTech at $60:
  - Don't exercise (why buy at $80 when market is $60?)
  - Loss: $40,000 (premium only)

#### Put Options (Right to SELL)

**How It Works:**
- Purchase the right to SELL shares at the current "strike price" by year-end
- Pay a premium upfront
- At year-end, if stock price is LOWER than your strike price, you exercise and profit
- If price is higher, you don't exercise (only lose premium)

**Example:**
- VitalCare Pharma is at $75
- You buy a put option for 5,000 shares at $75 strike
- Premium: $37,500 (10% of $375,000)
- **Year-End Scenario A** - VitalCare Pharma at $40:
  - Exercise! Sell at $75 when market is $40
  - Profit: ($75 - $40) √ó 5,000 - $37,500 = $137,500
- **Year-End Scenario B** - VitalCare Pharma at $100:
  - Don't exercise (why sell at $75 when market is $100?)
  - Loss: $37,500 (premium only)

#### Option Mechanics

**Availability:**

**Standard Variant:** Maximum 20% of each stock's shares can be under options per round
- Per stock limit: 40,000 shares (20% of 200,000)

**Extended Variant:** Maximum 20% of each stock's shares can be under options per round
- Per stock limit: 60,000 shares (20% of 300,000)

**Premium Rate:**
- Base premium: 10% of total strike value
- **Chairman Power**: Before cards are dealt, Chairman of each company can adjust THEIR company's premium by ¬±5%
  - Can set at 5%, 10%, or 15%
  - Must announce before anyone looks at cards
  - Strategic: Low premium (5%) encourages options trading; high premium (15%) discourages it

**Premium Calculation:**
- Premium = Strike Price √ó Number of Shares √ó Premium Rate
- Example: Omega Energy at $55, call option for 10,000 shares at 12% premium
  - Premium = $55 √ó 10,000 √ó 12% = $66,000

**Buying Options:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- Pay premium to bank immediately
- Record strike price, number of shares, and expiration (current market year)

**Exercise Timing:**
- Options are exercised at END of market year
- After price changes calculated
- After currency cards applied
- Before new round begins

**Important Limitations:**
- Options DO NOT count toward Director/Chairman ownership
- Options DO NOT receive dividends
- Options DO NOT qualify for Rights Issued
- Options are pure speculation without control benefits

### Dividends

Dividends allow Directors and Chairmen to extract cash from the company and pay all shareholders.

#### Who Can Issue Dividends

**Standard Variant:**
- **Director** (25-49% ownership): Up to $10 per share
- **Chairman** (50%+ ownership): Up to $20 per share

**Extended Variant:**
- **Director** (20-39% ownership): Up to $10 per share
- **Chairman** (40%+ ownership): Up to $20 per share

Both can issue in the same round (cumulative effect)

#### Dividend Mechanics

**Declaring Dividend:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- Announce dividend amount per share
- All shareholders receive payment IMMEDIATELY from the bank
- Stock price DROPS by dividend amount immediately

**Example:**
- You're Chairman of Global Industries with 100,000 shares
- Global Industries trading at $60
- You declare $15 dividend per share
- **Effects:**
  - You receive: $15 √ó 100,000 = $1,500,000
  - All other shareholders paid proportionally
  - Global Industries price drops to $45 immediately
  - Other players can use this cash in subsequent transactions this round

**Strategic Uses:**
- Extract value from expensive stocks
- Get cash for other investments
- Reduce stock price to make it more attractive to buyers
- Reward shareholders (including yourself)
- Deny put option holders (their strike becomes less valuable)

### Buybacks

Buybacks allow Chairmen to repurchase shares from the market, reducing supply and increasing price.

#### Who Can Issue Buybacks

**Both Variants:** Chairman only

#### Buyback Mechanics

**Announcing Buyback:**
- Uses one transaction turn
- Chairman declares:
  - Number of shares to buy back (e.g., 20,000)
  - Price per share (e.g., $55)

**Selling Priority - Turn Order:**
1. Starting with the NEXT player in turn order after Chairman
2. Each player in clockwise sequence can sell shares at announced price
3. First-come, first-served until buyback limit reached
4. Selling does NOT use the seller's transaction turn
5. Happens immediately within that same round

**Example:**
- Chairman announces: "Buying back 20,000 Omega Energy shares at $60"
- Turn order after Chairman: Bob ‚Üí Carol ‚Üí David
- Bob sells 8,000 shares (receives $480,000)
- Carol sells 15,000 shares (receives $900,000) ‚Äî LIMIT REACHED
- Only 12,000 bought from Carol; 3,000 refused
- David cannot sell (limit reached)

**Effects of Buyback:**
- Shares permanently retired from game
- Total shares outstanding decreases
- Everyone's ownership percentage increases
- Stock price increases: **+$5 per 10,000 shares bought back**

**Complete Example (Standard Variant):**
- You're Chairman of VitalCare Pharma with 100,000 shares (50% of 200,000)
- VitalCare Pharma at $75, total shares: 200,000
- You announce buyback: 30,000 shares at $78
- Players sell 30,000 shares total for $2,340,000
- **Results:**
  - Total shares now: 170,000 (30,000 retired)
  - Your ownership: 100,000 of 170,000 = 58.8% (was 50%)
  - Stock price: $75 + $15 ($5 per 10k) = $90
  - Your wealth increased significantly!

**Strategic Uses:**
- Consolidate control (increase your ownership %)
- Boost stock price
- Remove shares from competitors
- Deploy excess cash productively
- Defend against hostile takeover attempts
- Create upward price momentum

## Strategies to Win

### Early Game (Rounds 1-3)

1. **Buy Volatile Stocks When Cheap**
   - NovaTech and VitalCare Pharma at $10-30 are excellent investments
   - High volatility = high potential returns
   - Your cards will tell you which direction they'll move

2. **Aim for Director Status Fast**
   - **Standard:** 50,000 shares (25%)
   - **Extended:** 60,000 shares (20%)
   - Easier to achieve in early rounds when prices are low
   - Example (Standard): Atlas Bank at $15 = only $750,000 for Director status
   - Example (Extended): Atlas Bank at $15 = only $900,000 for Director status

3. **Read Your Cards**
   - If you have multiple positive cards for one stock, invest heavily
   - If you have negative cards, avoid that stock OR consider shorting (Investor Mode)

### Mid Game (Rounds 4-7)

4. **Push for Chairman Control**
   - **Standard:** 100,000 shares (50%)
   - **Extended:** 120,000 shares (40%)
   - Can manipulate stock prices by removing any player's cards
   - Your controlled stock becomes your wealth multiplier

5. **Watch Competitor Positions (ESPECIALLY in Extended Variant)**
   - With 7-12 players, control battles are fierce
   - If someone is approaching thresholds, consider:
     - Buying to block them
     - Using Share Suspended to hurt their stock
     - Buyback to consolidate your position (if Chairman)

6. **Extended Variant Tip: Lower Starting Capital Matters**
   - With $450k vs $600k, every transaction counts more
   - Be more conservative early
   - Focus on 1-2 stocks max for control

### Late Game (Rounds 8-10)

7. **Lock In Profits**
   - If ahead, shift to safer stocks
   - Use dividends to extract value (Strategist Mode)
   - Consider options for speculation instead of risky stock purchases

8. **Manage Cash vs Investment**
   - Watch for Currency +10% / -10% cards
   - Extended Variant: More Currency cards in play = higher variance
   - If you have -10% cards, invest all cash
   - If you have +10% cards, keep some cash uninvested

---

## Common Mistakes

### Standard Variant Specific

1. **Over-Diversifying**
   - With 200,000 shares available, spreading too thin is common
   - Focus on 1-2 companies for control

### Extended Variant Specific

2. **Underestimating Competition**
   - With 7-12 players, control is MUCH harder
   - Lower thresholds help, but still need ~$900k-$5M for Chairman
   - Focus fire on one stock early

3. **Ignoring Lower Starting Capital**
   - $450k vs $600k is a 25% reduction
   - Can't afford as many early mistakes
   - Rights Issued becomes MORE valuable (cheap shares)

4. **Not Adapting to Card Frequency**
   - Double deck = cards appear twice
   - Share Suspended appears 4 times (vs 2)
   - Currency cards appear 12 times total (vs 6)
   - Adjust strategies accordingly

## FAQ

### Variant Questions

**Q: Can I mix variants? Like 7 players with Standard rules?**  
A: Not recommended. Use Extended rules for 7+ players to ensure enough cards and shares.

**Q: What if we only have 6 players but want to try Extended rules?**  
A: You can! It will be more competitive with lower thresholds, but the game works fine.

**Q: In Extended variant, do Special Cards work differently?**  
A: No, all special cards work identically. There are just more of them (doubled).

**Q: In Extended variant, can I still buy/sell in 1,000 share minimums?**  
A: Yes, the $5,000 / 1,000 share minimum is the same in both variants.

**Q: Does the Extended variant change game length?**  
A: With more players, rounds take longer (more transactions). Expect 3-4 hours for 10-12 players vs 2-3 hours for 4-6 players.

### Ownership Questions

**Q: In Extended variant, if I have 55,000 shares, am I Director?**  
A: No. You need 60,000 shares (20% of 300,000) for Director status.

**Q: Can there be multiple Directors in Extended variant?**  
A: Yes, if multiple players have 20-39% ownership. The player with the most shares gets Director powers if only one slot.

**Q: In Extended variant with 12 players, is it harder to become Chairman?**  
A: Yes and no. The threshold is lower (40% vs 50%) but there's more competition. It balances out.
