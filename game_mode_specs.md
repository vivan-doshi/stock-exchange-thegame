## Balancing Considerations

### Mode Balance Goals
1. Each mode should feel **meaningfully different**
2. Advanced modes should NOT obsolete basic strategies
3. Complexity should add **depth**, not just **complication**
4. New players in Trader should have fun
5. Experts in Mogul should still find challenge
6. **Both variants should be balanced**

### Tested Balance Points
- **Shorting:** 12,000 share cap prevents game-breaking positions
- **Options (Standard):** 40,000 share (20%) cap ensures stocks remain primary
- **Options (Extended):** 60,000 share (20%) cap maintains same proportion
- **Dividends:** Director/Chairman split prevents one power from dominating
- **Buybacks:** $5 price increase per 10k prevents inflation

### Extended Variant Balance
- Lower starting capital ($450k) creates more scarcity
- Lower thresholds (20%/40%) keep control achievable
- More shares (300k) prevent market exhaustion
- Double deck prevents card counting
