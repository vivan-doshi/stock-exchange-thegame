## 🔧 How It Works

### **User Profile Creation**

**Two-layer protection:**

1. **Client-Side Fallback** (AuthContext.tsx)
   - Checks if profile exists on sign-in
   - Creates it if missing
   - Always works!

2. **Database Trigger** (Optional)
   - Auto-creates profile on signup
   - First line of defense

### **Game Creation Flow**

```
User clicks "Create Game"
    ↓
Modal opens with settings
    ↓
User configures: mode, variant, players, public/private
    ↓
Click "Create"
    ↓
Game created with status='waiting', round=0
    ↓
User added as first player with is_host=true
    ↓
Navigate to waiting room
```

### **Join Game Flow**

```
Option A: Click game from lobby list
Option B: Enter game code manually
    ↓
Validate: game exists, not full, status='waiting'
    ↓
Add player to game_players
    ↓
Navigate to waiting room
    ↓
All players see real-time updates
```

### **Start Game Flow**

```
Players mark themselves as ready
    ↓
Host clicks "Start Game" (when 2+ ready)
    ↓
Game updated: status='in_progress', round=1
    ↓
Realtime subscription detects change
    ↓
All players auto-navigate to /game/:gameId
```

## 🎯 Database Schema

### **games table**
```
game_id (UUID) - Primary key
host_user_id → auth.users(id)
game_mode: 'trader' | 'investor' | 'strategist'
game_variant: 'standard' | 'extended'
status: 'waiting' | 'in_progress' | 'completed'
current_round: 0-10 (0 = waiting)
max_players: 2-12
is_public: boolean
```

### **game_players table**
```
player_id (UUID) - Primary key
game_id → games(game_id)
user_id → auth.users(id)
player_position: 1-12
is_ready: boolean
is_host: boolean
cash_balance, stock_holdings, etc.
```

### **game_profiles table**
```
user_id → auth.users(id) - Primary key
username: text
games_played_trader, games_won_trader, etc.
highest_net_worth
investor_unlocked, strategist_unlocked
preferences
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Error: "relation game_profiles does not exist"**
→ Run `APPLY_THIS_NOW.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### **Error: "policy already exists"**
→ This is handled! Policies are dropped before creating

### **Error: "foreign key constraint violated"**
→ Make sure you ran the migration that fixes foreign keys

### **Can't sign in with new account**
→ The client-side fallback should handle this automatically

### **Username not showing in lobby**
→ Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → game_profiles
→ Should have entry for your user_id

### **Game not appearing in lobby**
→ Check game status is 'waiting'
→ Check is_public is true
→ Refresh the page
